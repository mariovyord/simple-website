# My Website

This website was created through "vibe coding" - a coding philosophy where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It's not about the technical details; it's about the feeling, the flow, and the fun. Pure vibes, zero thoughts.

Made with ðŸ’š and terminal aesthetics in 2025.
